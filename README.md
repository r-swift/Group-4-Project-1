# Overview
We are an investment firm and many of our younger, Millenial and Gen Z investors have become increasingly interested is companies and their ESG score. We have recieved several enquireies from our clients all centered around one question. 

Can I use a companies ESG rating to determine whether or not I should invest in a company?

In order to answer this we decided to isolate Annualized Growth and Earnings Per Share (EPS) using ESG grade data provided from ESG Governance for 722 individual stocks spread across 47 Sectors to try and determine if a correlation exists by asking the following questions.

* What are the top rated ESG companies?
* What are the average ESG ratings by Sector?
* What are the 5 year annualized averages and EPS scores for the avaliable bins AA, A, BBB, BB, B?
