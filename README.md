# Overview
We are an investment firm and many of our younger, Millenial and Gen Z investors have become increasingly interested is companies and their ESG score. We have recieved several enquireies from our clients all centered around one question. 

Can I use a companies ESG rating to determine whether or not I should invest in a company?

In order to answer this we decided to isolate Annualized Growth and Earnings Per Share (EPS) using ESG grade data provided from ESG Governance to try and determine is a correlation exists.
