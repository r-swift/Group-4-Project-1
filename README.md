# Overview
We are an investment firm and many of our younger, Millenial and Gen Z investors, have become increasingly interested is companies and their ESG score. We have recieved several enquireies from our clients all centered around one question. 

Can I use a companies ESG rating to determine whether or not I should invest in a company?

We secured a ESG Grading Database from ESG Governance containing 722 companies spread across 47 Sectors. This grading broke the companies into grading bins, AA, A, BBB, BB, B. 

We then used the AlphaVantage API to pull stock data for the companies in order to isolate 5 year price average and EPS data.

* What are the top rated ESG companies?
* What are the average ESG ratings by Sector?
* What are the 5 year annualized averages and EPS scores for the avaliable bins AA, A, BBB, BB, B?
* Is there any correlation between the 4 year annualized averages and EPS data and ESG grade rating?



# Analysis and Conclusion
We began our analysis by creating a clean csv file using combined data from the ESG csv and the API data calls from AlphaVantage. Once we had this csv we began to dive deeper into the data.
